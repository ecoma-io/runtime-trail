#!/usr/bin/env node
// Fails on any local reference to a document that does not exist, in either of
// the two shapes a reference takes in this repository:
//
//   1. Markdown links `[text](target)` — the target's file must exist, resolved
//      relative to the file that carries the link, and a `#anchor` fragment
//      naming a heading in that SAME file must match a heading actually there.
//      A link carried by a page INSIDE docs/ must land INSIDE docs/: the
//      documentation is a self-contained tree, so a docs page that links to
//      `../CONTRIBUTING.md` or `../../packages/…` is a failure — its subject
//      belongs in docs/, and a reader of docs/ is a docs reader. Markdown
//      files OUTSIDE docs/ keep the right to link INTO docs/ (the direction a
//      reader is steered toward); only the reverse is refused.
//   2. Prose citations `docs/...` or `../docs/...` in `.mjs` comments and
//      strings and in `.md` prose — resolved from the workspace root when they
//      begin with `docs/`, from the carrying file when they begin with `../` or
//      `./`.
//   3. Path references in `.yml`/`.yaml` — a workflow input, a glob, a comment
//      citing a file. A reference counts as a claim about THIS tree only when
//      its first segment is a real entry at the repository root; that one test
//      is what keeps `actions/checkout@…`, `repos/$REPO/git/refs/…` and
//      `/usr/bin/bash` out of the judgment without a list of exceptions to
//      maintain. Judged from the repository root, and a glob is judged by the
//      longest prefix before its first wildcard.
//
//      A reference is judged only when it names a FILE — it carries an
//      extension, or a wildcard. `core/action` in the prose "the core/action
//      boundary" is two English words with a slash between them, and no rule
//      about repository paths can tell it from a path; requiring an extension
//      is what separates them, and the cost is that a bare directory
//      reference like `.github/semgrep` goes unjudged. Comments stay in scope
//      deliberately: a comment citing a workflow that was renamed is the same
//      lie as an input naming it.
//
//      A path that belongs to the CONSUMER's repository rather than to this
//      one is marked `# consumer path` on its line — `review/action.yaml`'s
//      `instructions-path` default is the case that exists, and its own
//      description says missing is fine. The marker is a claim someone wrote
//      down, the way `tools/check-uses-refs.mjs` takes `# roadmap ref`.
//
// Shape 3 exists because of a specific failure. `analysis.yml` carried
// `config-file: .github/codeql/config.yml` — a file inherited from a previous
// repository and never created here. Every local gate passed, and CodeQL went
// red on the first push with "the configuration file does not exist". The gate
// that should have caught it was reading `.md`, `.mjs` and `.js` only, so the
// one reference shape a workflow uses was the one shape nothing read.
//
// WHY this script exists. The docs live in docs/, and a reader of docs/ is a
// docs reader: a page there must not link out to a root markdown file or a
// package README, and no reference — markdown link or prose citation — may
// point at a path that does not exist. No existing gate saw either failure:
// Prettier formats markdown but does not resolve a link, markdownlint's
// closest rule (MD051) checks only `#anchor` fragments within one file, and
// ESLint never reads prose. A broken reference is invisible until someone
// clicks it.
//
// The facts are read from the filesystem by `readFacts`; the judgment is the
// pure function `evaluate`, which takes those facts as arguments and returns
// verdicts, so the tests need no filesystem and no mocking library.
//
// Resolution rules, stated once:
//   - a markdown link target resolves relative to the file that carries it;
//   - a citation beginning with `docs/` resolves from the workspace root
//     (this repository's convention for prose references);
//   - a citation beginning with `../` or `./` resolves from its carrying file;
//   - a page inside docs/ may only link to another page inside docs/;
//   - everything else is not a reference to this repository's docs and is
//     ignored.
//
// External targets (`http:`, `https:`, `mailto:`) and fragment-only targets
// on a DIFFERENT file are not resolved: the first lives outside the tree this
// gate can see, and the second is a promise about another file's headings that
// GitHub's own anchor handling does not even guarantee — a `#fragment` on the
// same file is checked because markdownlint's MD051 does it and it is cheap;
// a `file.md#fragment` one is checked only for the file half.
